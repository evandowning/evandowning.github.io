## Where do I get songs from?

### Overview

A lot of my songs are old (shared between friends from the days of iTunes and iPods). Others have been purchased from or released for free by various artists (pay attention to their social media ðŸ˜‰).

Over the years, I've collected 500-600 zouk (or zoukable) songs ðŸ‘€ I'm always listening for new songs I hear from Youtube, Zouk events, TV shows (the Bachelor series is great for new songs), or while walking through the airport.

Feel free to email DJs personally -- they're very kind and responsive and generally love to share or sell their hard work to help you get your Zouk song collection started!

#### DJs

* DJ Alexy: <https://soundcloud.com/dj-alexy-874739139>
* DJ Calado: <https://soundcloud.com/djcalado>
* BCD Zoukreators: <https://www.youtube.com/@BCDZoukreators>

#### Music

You can download songs for free from YouTube: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp>. It's not the best audio quality, but it's good enough in my experience. In general, dancers won't notice, but other DJs (or audiophiles) will ðŸ˜‰

## Strategy

* DJ by feel (does what I do sound good?)
* Simplicity (don't complicate things -- DJ smarter, not harder)
* Practice! Practice! Practice! (I use socials to practice -- no need to practice at home all the time)

### Transitioning

* Key (harmonic)
* Energy (match)
* BPM (match)
* Find your hot cue
* Loop in
* Adjust volume/bass/treble/etc.
* Transition
* Loop out

I've never received formal training. Each DJ's style is different. You'll find your own style and songs you like to play. Just make sure you enjoy it!

### Picking songs

I'm selfish. I pick songs I like, first and foremost. If I don't like what I'm playing, I can't enjoy it.

Adjust songs to be between 70-80 BPM. Use whatever you think sounds best.

### Picking the next song

I look at songs that would harmonize with the current song playing. I listen to a new song on my headphones while the other song is playing live.

### How to find songs that harmonize

Songs have keys. You can configure your DJ software (like Serato) to label song keys using the Camelot notation. This makes it easier for you to know which songs will harmonize and which won't.

The next song should have either (but NOT both):

  * +/- one letter
  * +/- one number

Play around and see what sounds good to you!

### How to find songs with the same "energy"

Trial-and-error. Skip through the song you're previewing. See where it's best to start and end the song. You can even color-code songs with similar energy for yourself to note for your future sets.

### How to transition so it's not distracting for dancers

Loop an introduction (beat or vocals). Gradually transition so that the dancers "hear" that loop. Move the volumes, reduce the bass in the current song, increase the base in the next song, decrease the treble in the current song, and exit the next song's loop so it continues.
