#### BDHunter - 2021

* Helped write this paper and performed some analyses.
* **Publication**: Identifying Behavior Dispatchers for Malware Analysis (AsiaCCS 2021)

#### DeepReflect - 2021

* Trained a deep learning model to detect malicious functions within malware binaries using instruction- and CFG-based features. It is particularly useful when symbols and strings are missing, forcing the analyst to otherwise execute the malware in a dynamic sandbox.
* **Publication**: DeepReflect: Discovering Malicious Functionality through Binary Reconstruction (USENIX 2021)
* **Repository**: <https://github.com/evandowning/deepreflect>
* **Techniques**: Python, BinaryNinja, Scikit-learn, Keras

#### D3 (TII drone research) - 2021-2022

* Assisted a post-doc and PhD student in designing a drone intrusion detection methodology based on external environmental data (e.g., sound of the propellers spinning).
* Soldered and installed a Pi-connect, Raspberry pi, and microphone array onto the drone to collect telemetry data.

* **Techniques**: Python

#### MLSploit (Intel ARSA) - 2017-2019

* Assisted in the design and development of MLSploit, a flexible framework enabling machine learning model training and generating attacks to evade those models.
* Utilized Python, Scikit-learn, and Keras to create various malware detection models and employed binary rewriting for executable malware that dynamically evades detection.
