**BDHunter** - 2021

  * I helped write this paper and performed some analyses.
  * **Publication**: Identifying Behavior Dispatchers for Malware Analysis (AsiaCCS 2021)

&nbsp;

**DeepReflect** - 2021

  * I trained a deep learning model to detect malicious functions within malware binaries using instruction- and CFG-based features. It is particularly useful when symbols and strings are missing, forcing the analyst to otherwise execute the malware in a dynamic sandbox.
  * **Publication**: DeepReflect: Discovering Malicious Functionality through Binary Reconstruction (USENIX 2021)
  * **Repository**: [https://github.com/evandowning/deepreflect](https://github.com/evandowning/deepreflect)
  * **Techniques**: Python, BinaryNinja, Scikit-learn, Keras

**D3 (TII drone research)** - 2021 - 2022

  * I assisted a post-doc and PhD student in designing a drone intrusion detection methodology based on external environmental data (e.g., sound of the propellers spinning).
  * I also soldered and installed a Pi-connect, Raspberry pi, and microphone array onto the drone to collect telemetry data.

**MLSploit (Intel ARSA)** - 2017 - 2019

  * I assisted in the design and development of MLSploit, a flexible framework to enable (1) training machine learning models and (2) generating attacks to evade those models.
  * I used Python, Scikit-learn, and Keras to create various malware detection models and binary rewriting to create executable malware which dynamically evades those models.

**Oak Ridge National Laboratory** - 06/2013 - 09/2013

  * I worked with a research group to develop and test a new method of detecting malicious intrusions into computers. This included modifying the Linux kernel, modifying rootkits, and
working with advanced encryption.
  * **Publication**: Beholder: Phase-Space Detection of Cyber Events (2013)
  * **Techniques**: C

&nbsp;

**Oak Ridge National Laboratory** - 05/2012 - 08/2012

  * I worked with my mentor to develop a JavaScript-based Application Programming
Interface (API) to enable users to build many flexible scatterplots easily. This API will be
used in a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) study for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) that will determine the amount of information needed in a visual
representation in order to communicate the intended information to the viewer.
I also worked with my group on two other projects that dealt with analyzing computer
network traffic to determine whether the traffic was malicious or anomalous. I was tasked
with assisting the construction and design of both projectsâ€™ visual interfaces.
  * **Publications**:
    * situ: Situational Understanding and Discovery for Cyber Attacks (2012)
    * NV: Nessus Vulnerability Visualization for the Web (VizSec 2012)
  * **Techniques**: JavaScript, CSS, HTML

**Oak Ridge National Laboratory** - 05/2011 - 07/2011

  * I worked with the U.S. Marines and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to
develop maintenance durability and cost/progress visualizations using Protovis, which is
a JavaScript visualization library.
  * **Techniques**: JavaScript, CSS, HTML
